# FinancialTracker
The aim of my project is to develop a dynamic web application to help people track their income and expenses, providing them with an overview of their finances. The target users of the web application are anyone who wants to improve their financial situation by understanding their spending habits.
The overall structure of the web app consists of several components:
  - User Interface (UI) for displaying and interacting with the application.
  - Authentication and User Management for handling user accounts and login/logout functionality.
  - Expense Tracking for managing income and expense entries by categories.
  - Data Visualization for presenting financial data in a visually appealing format.
  - Backend Services for handling server-side logic, data storage, and communication with the database.
  
For the development of the web app, I intend to use HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS for the front-end to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. For the back-end, I plan to use Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic and API endpoints, and MongoDB for data storage to ensure scalability and flexibility in managing financial data.
